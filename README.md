# DrinksAPI

A RESTful API for cocktail and shot recipes.


## Why (Motivation for Creating)

The DrinksAPI was created to better understand APIs. The goal was to gain a better understanding of how APIs are created, maintained, secured, and distributed. Already having an understanding of the Django framework, working with the Django Rest Framework seemed to be best next step in understanding APIs.

## Usage Guide

**Basic Information**

At this time only the HTTP GET method is available for the DrinksAPI. The DrinksAPI is for counsumption only, and does not require authentication.

This API is free to use and does not have a rate limit, but in order to keep hosting cost down, I ask that you limit the frequency of your requests.

**Fair Use Policy**

The DrinksAPI is free to use and generally serves as a data set for aspiring developers to practice with. Service attacks and other actions that go against the fair and responsible use of the API will not be tolerated. Users who fail to comply with the fair use policy will have their IP address permanently bannded.

**User Etiquette**

Be courteous and helpful to fellow developers.
Locally cache API resources when they are requested.
Report vulnerabilities responsibly when spotted.
